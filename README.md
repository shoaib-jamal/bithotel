# BitHotel

![](public/main.png)

Choose an avatar and hang out with your friends in a virtual version of a 16-bit pixel based hotel, situated in a retro arena

BitHotel is built with node.js, socket.io, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and the add-on [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/), it's hosted on [heroku.com](https://heroku.com/)  

## Contributing
You may contribute to the code by sending pull requests. If you are a pixel art designer, you may update the designs as well as the hotel appearance. Trust me, it means alot for the BitHotel family.

BitHotel is based on LIKELIKE, an awesome project by [Molleindustria](http://molleindustria.org/).
